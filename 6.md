# Describe Azure cost management and Service Level Agreements (10-15%)
## Describe methods for planning and managing costs
### identify factors that can affect costs (resource types, services, locations, ingress and egress traffic)
Factors affecting costs - Different services are billed based on different factors

Free services
- Resource groups
- Virtual network (up to 50)
- Load balancer (basic)
- Azure Active Directory (basic)
- Network security groups
- Free-tier web apps (up to 10)

Pay per usage (consumption model)

Opportunity for cost savings
Azure Functions - 1 million executions free per month

Pay per usage services
- Functions
- Logic Apps
- Storage (pay per GB)
- Outbound bandwidth
- Cognitive Services API

Pay for time (per second) - Per second billing means billing stops when the VM is stopped

Pay for bandwidth
- First 5 GB is free
- Inbound data is free

Bandwidth costs - it depends on region

### identify factors that can reduce costs (reserved instances, reserved capacity, hybrid use benefit, spot pricing) Describe the functionality and usage of the Pricing calculator and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
Stability in pricing
- Pay a fixed price per month for computing power or storage capacity Whether you use it or not
- Discounts for 1-year or 3-year commitment in VM (Reserved Instances)

Best practices for minimizing Azure costs
- Azure Advisor cost tab
- Auto shutdown on dev/qa resources
- Utilize cool/archive storage where possible
- Reserved instances
- Configure alerts when billing exceeds an expected level
- Use Policy to restrict access to certain expensive resources
- Auto scaling resources
- Downsize when resources over-provisioned
- Ensure every resource has an owner (tags)
- Spot Pricing

[Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

Configurable Options
- Region
- Tier
- Subscription Type
- Support Options
- Dev/Test Pricing

Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator - [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/)

Other costs
- Electricity
- Cooling
- Internet connectivity
- Rack space
- Setup labor
- Maintenance labor
- Backup

## Describe Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and service lifecycles
[Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/support/legal/sla/)

### identify actions that can impact an SLA (i.e. Availability Zones)
With availability zones i can increase SLA for service

### describe the service lifecycle in Azure (Public Preview and General Availability)
Private preview -> Public preview -> General Availability (GA)
